# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

- 

## Motivation

- Provide a graphical illustration of how standard consumer and producer theory can be used to quantify the welfare loss associated with inefficient pricing in insurance markets with selection
- Show how this welfare loss can be estimated empirically using identifying variation in the price of insurance
  - The variation, together with quantity data, allows us to estimate the demand for insurance
  - The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurers' costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price
- Apply the above approach to data on health insurance form one specific company, detecting adverse selection but its impacts are small


## Related Literature

- Estimate the welfare costs of private information in insurance markets
  - Annuities: Einav, Finkelstein, and Schrimpf (2010)
  - Health Insurance: Bundorf, Levin, and Mahoney (2008); Carlin and Town (2009); Lustig (2009)

## Contribution

- Propose a complementary approach to empirical welfare analysis in insurance markets
- Make fewer assumptions about the underlying primitives, yet impose enough structure to allow meaningful welfare analysis

# Details of the Paper

## Model

**Setup and Notation**

- Consumers choose from two available insurance contracts: 
  - Contract $H$, full insurance with price $p$
  - Contract $L$, no insurance available for free
- Characteristics of the insurance contracts as given, although we allow the price of insurance to be determined endogenously
- $G(\zeta)$: distribution of the population, where $\zeta$ is a vector of consumer characteristics
- $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p)$, $v^{L}(\zeta_{i})$: consumer $i$'s (with characteristics) utility from buying contracts $H$ and $L$, respectively
- Assume that $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p)$ is strictly decreasing in $p$ and that $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p = 0) > v^{L}(\zeta_{i})$
