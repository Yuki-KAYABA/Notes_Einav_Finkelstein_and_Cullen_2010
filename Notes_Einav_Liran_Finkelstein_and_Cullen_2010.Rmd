# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

- 

## Motivation

- Provide a graphical illustration of how standard consumer and producer theory can be used to quantify the welfare loss associated with inefficient pricing in insurance markets with selection
- Show how this welfare loss can be estimated empirically using identifying variation in the price of insurance
  - The variation, together with quantity data, allows us to estimate the demand for insurance
  - The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurers' costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price
- Apply the above approach to data on health insurance form one specific company, detecting adverse selection but its impacts are small


## Related Literature

  - Annuities: Einav, Finkelstein, and Schrimpf (2010)
  - Health Insurance: Bundorf, Levin, and Mahoney (2008); Carlin and Town (2009); Lustig (2009)

## Contribution

- Propose a complementary approach to empirical welfare analysis in insurance markets
- Make fewer assumptions about the underlying primitives, yet impose enough structure to allow meaningful welfare analysis

# Details of the Paper

## Model

### Setup and Notation

- Consumers choose from two available insurance contracts: 
  - Contract $H$, full insurance with price $p$
  - Contract $L$, no insurance available for free
- Characteristics of the insurance contracts as given, although we allow the price of insurance to be determined endogenously
- $G(\zeta)$: distribution of the population, where $\zeta$ is a vector of consumer characteristics
- $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p)$, $v^{L}(\zeta_{i})$: consumer $i$'s (with characteristics) utility from buying contracts $H$ and $L$, respectively
- Assume that $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p)$ is strictly decreasing in $p$ and that $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p = 0) > v^{L}(\zeta_{i})$
- $c(\zeta_{i})$: the expected monetary cost associated with the insurable risk for individual $i$

### Demand for Insurance

- Each individual makes a discrete choice of whether to buy insurance or not
- Assume that firms cannot offer different prices to different individuals
- Then, individual $i$ chooses to buy insurance if and only if $v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p) \geq v^{L}(\zeta_{i})$
- Define $\pi(\zeta_{i}) \equiv \max \{ p: v^{H}(\zeta_{i}, p) \geq v^{L}(\zeta_{i}) \}$
- Aggregate demand for insurance is therefore given by:

$$
D(p) = \int 1(\pi(\zeta) \geq p)dG(\zeta) = \Pr(\pi(\zeta_{i}) \geq p)
$$

- Assume that $D(p)$ is strictly decreasing, continuous, and differentiable

### Supply and Equilibrium

- Consider $N \geq 2$ identical risk-neutral insurance providers, who set prices in a Nash equilibrium
- Assume that when multiple firms set the same price, individuals who decide to purchase insurance at this price choose a firm randomly
- Assume that the only costs of providing contract $H$ to individual $i$ are the insurable cost $c(\zeta_{i})$
- The above assumptions imply that at the average (expected) cost curve in the market:

$$
AC(p) = \frac{1}{D(p)} \int c(\zeta)1(\pi(\zeta) \geq p)dG(\zeta) = E(c(\zeta) \mid \pi(\zeta) \geq p)
$$

- The marginal (expected) cost curve in the market

$$
MC(p) = E(c(\zeta) \mid \pi(\zeta) = p)
$$

Add two further simplifying assumptions to straightforwardly characterize equilibrium.

1. Assume that there exists a price $\overline{p}$ such that $D(\overline{p}) > 0$ and $MC(p) < p$ for every $p > \overline{p}$
  - In words, we assume that it is profitable (and efficient, as we will see soon) to provide insurance to those with the highest willingness to pay for it
2. Assume that if there exists $\underline{p}$ such that $MC(\underline{p}) > \underline{p}$, then $MC(p) > p$ for all $p < \underline{p}$. 
  - That is, we assume that $MC(p)$ crosses the demand curve at most once

- These assumptions guarantee the easy to verify that these assumptions guarantee the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium
- In particular, the equilibrium is characterized by the lowest break-even price, that is,

$$
p^{*} = \min \{ p: p = AC(p) \}
$$
